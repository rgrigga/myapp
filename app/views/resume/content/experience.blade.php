		<h1>Work History</h1>
		<p>After spending roughly 15 years in Sales and Mortgage Banking, I decided in early 2013 that I wanted to focus my career on technology.  My diverse work history qualifies me for a number of things.</p>

				<h4 STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Description</h4>
				<p>Residential mortgage lending focused on HARP, FNMA, FHLMC, FHA, and VA loan programs… As a Mortgage Banker in the national call center, I serviced customers all across the country. I was "team lead" for my immediate sales team, and demonstrated consistent leadership as measured by many production metrics, e.g Top 10% Nationally of ~900 Mortgage Bankers in "Consumer Direct" department.  Handled mostly inbound and some outbound sales calls with existing Chase Refinance Customers.  Developed tracking tools and calculators to assist in my duties.  Please ask for me details, I love talking about it :).</p>
