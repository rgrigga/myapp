	<!-- <h3>3-tier architechture</h3> -->
	<h5>Model</h5>
	<h5>View</h5>
	<h5>Controller</h5>
	<h5>Data</h5>
	<h5>Presenter</h5>
	<h5>Frameworks</h5>
	<p>Languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
	Frameworks/CMS: JQuery, JQuery Mobile, Laravel (v3 & 4), CodeIgniter, Bootstrap (2.3.2, 3.0), Wordpress
	Version Control: I would describe my knowledge of Git, Github and BitBucket as "intermediate".  
	More: AJAX, LESS, JSON, SEO and more
	Other Software: I use Sublime Text, Inkscape, GIMP, & lots more (PS: I do not own Photoshop, Illustrator, etc., but I have no fear if those would be preferred/required).  I am somewhat familiar with Eclipse, and several other editors/IDE's.
	OS/Environments: Linux (I prefer Ubuntu/Mint).  I also have several Windows machines.
	I am also interested in: Ruby, Java, Android, iPhone, OAuth, Facebook Open Graph just to name a few.  (I can say little more than "hello world" with these, but I am actively studying them.
	Other: Ask me about "The JCC" (an enterprise web app I built before "web apps" existed).  I have some experience with general network and system administration, in both windows and linux environments.  My local development environment is synchronized with a remote webhost.  I also manage a multi-site wordpress installation, and I have done other similar things in the past: a MediWiki installation, for example.  I once created and administrated a small office virtual machine environment with VMWare.
